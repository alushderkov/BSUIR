# Compilers

This part contains projects related to the "Compilers" course. As part of the course, various compilation stages were implemented, including lexical and syntax analysis.

## Contents

### 1. Lexical Analysis
This section includes two projects:
- **Manual implementation of a lexical analyzer**: Development of a custom analyzer that breaks down input code into tokens without using external tools.
- **Lexical analysis using Flex**: A project where a lexical analyzer is created using Flex for automatic scanner generation.

### 2. Syntax Analysis
Projects on syntax analysis include parser development, LL(1) and LR(1) analysis, expression parsing, and syntax tree construction.

### 3. Code Generation
Code generation is one of the key stages of compilation, where the intermediate representation of a program is transformed into machine-oriented or executable code.

### 4. Code Optimization
This section covers various code optimization techniques aimed at improving performance, reducing size, and efficiently utilizing resources.

### 5. Parallelism and Program Analysis
This section examines approaches to parallel computing and program analysis to identify potential opportunities for multi-threaded execution and performance optimization.

## Usage
Each project has a separate folder with a README containing instructions for building and running the code.

## Additional Information
This repository may be useful for students studying compilers as well as developers interested in creating their own programming languages.
