# ðŸ…² Programming

This section contains theoretical materials and practical exercises covering various aspects of the C programming language.

## Theoretical Materials

Theoretical topics covered include fundamental concepts, data types, operators, control structures, memory management, and advanced features of C:

- **Data Types**: `int`, `char`, floating-point numbers.
- **Modifiers**: `const`, `volatile`.
- **Basic Input/Output**: Standard I/O functions.
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, bitwise, shift, assignment, type conversion, and logical operations.
- **Control Structures**: `if`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`), `break`, `continue`, `goto`, and conditional (`?:`).
- **Arrays and Pointers**: Single and multidimensional arrays, pointer operations, dynamic memory allocation, pointer arrays, pointer arithmetic.
- **Functions**: Function declarations, parameter passing, recursion, function pointers.
- **Storage Classes**: `auto`, `register`, `static`, `extern`.
- **Structures and Unions**: Struct initialization, nested structures, pointers to structures, `typedef`, bit fields, enumerations.
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees.
- **File Handling**: Text and binary file operations, random access, file I/O functions.
- **Preprocessor Directives**: `#include`, `#define`, `#undef`, conditional compilation, preventing multiple inclusions.
- **Compilation and Linking**: Linker operation, name mangling.
- **Undefined Behavior**: Causes, consequences, and variable program behavior.
- **Variadic Functions**: Functions with a variable number of parameters.

## Practical Exercises

Alongside theoretical materials, this section includes files with solutions to basic algorithmic problems implemented in C. These exercises reinforce understanding of core programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## Usage

The knowledge and skills gained from this section are essential for various areas of software development:

- **Systems Programming**: Writing low-level software, including operating systems and embedded systems.
- **Algorithm Design**: Implementing efficient algorithms and data structures.
- **Game Development**: Optimizing performance in game engines.
- **Embedded Systems**: Programming microcontrollers and hardware-level applications.
- **Networking**: Developing network protocols and low-level communication systems.
- **Compilers and Interpreters**: Understanding parsing, memory management, and code optimization.

Mastering C provides a strong foundation for low-level programming and serves as a stepping stone to other languages like C++, Rust, and Assembly.
