# Collection and Analysis of Discrete and Continuous Data üìä

## About the Project üèÜ
This project is a comprehensive statistical analysis of discrete and continuous data. The study evaluates distribution laws, calculates numerical characteristics of samples, constructs graphical models, and tests statistical hypotheses. The work includes an in-depth theoretical analysis, practical application of mathematical statistics methods, and data visualization.

## Key Analysis Objectives üîç
- **Evaluation of distribution laws** for discrete and continuous data.
- **Calculation of numerical characteristics** (mathematical expectation, variance, mode, median, kurtosis, skewness, etc.).
- **Construction of variation series**, discrete and interval distributions.
- **Data visualization** using histograms, polygons, and empirical distribution functions.
- **Hypothesis testing** regarding data distribution using Pearson's chi-squared test.
- **Data analysis in Excel** and result interpretation.
