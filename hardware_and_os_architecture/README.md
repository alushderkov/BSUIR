# Hardware and OS Architecture

## Overview

This section is dedicated to hardware architecture and operating systems. It includes methodological materials and study projects that cover key concepts of computer systems—from digital logic to process and thread management in OS.

## Structure

### Auxiliary Literature  
A collection of theoretical materials covering a wide range of topics:  
- **Operating System Architecture**: processes, threads, memory management, file systems.  
- **Hardware**: transistors, digital devices, memory hierarchy, the evolution of PC architecture.  
- **Linux**: fundamental principles of operating system functionality.  

Main files:
- `ADC_and_CDA.pdf` – Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters.
- `Basic_Digital_Devices.pdf` – Basic digital devices.
- `File_System.pdf` – File systems.
- `OS_Architecture.pdf` – Operating system architecture.
- `Processes_and_Threads_1.pdf`, `Processes_and_Threads_2.pdf` – Processes and threads.
- `Memory_Hierarchy.pdf` – Memory hierarchy.
- ...and other materials.

### Projects  
Contains practical work demonstrating the application of theory in real-world tasks.

Main projects:
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit Modeling (ALU.pdf)**  
  Development of an ALU capable of performing basic arithmetic and logic operations.
  
- **Working with File Systems (Files_and_Directories.pdf)**  
  Low-level file and directory management.

- **Linux Basics (Linux_Basics.pdf)**  
  Practical tasks related to Linux commands and features.

- **Processes and Threads (Processes_and_Threads.pdf)**  
  Managing multitasking in operating systems.

- **Signal Handling (Signals.pdf)**  
  Implementation of signal handling mechanisms in Unix-like systems.

## Objectives and Significance

The provided materials and projects help to:  
- Understand modern OS architecture and computer hardware.  
- Work effectively with low-level programming.  
- Optimize processes and resources in system programming.  
- Gain a deeper understanding of Linux and file system principles.  

## Conclusion

These works demonstrate a solid theoretical foundation and practical skills in system programming. Despite their academic nature, they can serve as a basis for solving real-world problems in low-level development and operating systems.
